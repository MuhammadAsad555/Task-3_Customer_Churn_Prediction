# Customer_Churn_Prediction
Customer Churn Prediction
Overview

This project predicts customer churn (whether a customer will leave the service or not) using machine learning models. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The goal is to help businesses reduce churn by identifying at-risk customers in advance.
